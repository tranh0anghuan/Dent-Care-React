        <h1>Common Types of Braces</h1>
        <p>There are various orthodontic methods to meet the diverse needs of customers. Depending on the condition of your teeth, desires, and financial situation, the dentist will recommend suitable aesthetic braces.</p>
        <h4><i className="fas fa-gem" /> Metal Braces</h4>
        <p>Metal braces involve fixing a system of brackets and wires onto the teeth, creating force to move the teeth into the desired position. There are several types of brackets:</p>   
        <ul id="ul">
            <li><strong>Standard Metal Brackets:</strong> Highly effective due to their sturdy metal frame, the force exerted by the brackets and bands makes it easier to adjust teeth to the desired position. Cost: from 35,000,000 VND.</li>
            <img src="/Othdontics2.jpg" id="img" alt="Standard Metal Brackets" />
            <li><strong>Ceramic Brackets:</strong> With brackets and bands matching the natural tooth color, ceramic braces offer high aesthetic value, making customers feel more confident in daily communication. Cost: from 40,000,000 VND.</li>
            <img src="/Orthdontics3.jpg" id="img" alt="Ceramic Brackets" />
            <li><strong>Self-ligating Brackets:</strong> Designed with flexible clips (metal or ceramic) that can open and close to secure the wire in the bracket slot, allowing the wire to slide freely. This maintains stable force, reduces friction, and minimizes pain and the risk of bracket detachment. Cost: from 40,000,000 VND.</li>
            <img src="/Orthdontics4.jpg" id="img" alt="Self-ligating Brackets" />
            <li><strong>Lingual Braces:</strong> The braces are placed on the inside of the teeth, providing high aesthetic value as you can smile and communicate freely without showing any braces. However, they move teeth slowly and can be uncomfortable. Cost: around 100,000,000 VND.</li>
            <img src="/Orthdontics5.jpg" id="img" alt="Lingual Braces" />
            <h4><i className="fas fa-gem" /> Clear Aligners</h4>
            <p>Instead of using a system of brackets and wires, clear aligners use transparent, flexible plastic trays that fit snugly over the teeth, creating force to move and align misaligned teeth. Cost: from 42,000,000 VND.</p>
            <li><strong>High Aesthetic Value:</strong> The aligners are nearly invisible, so you don't have to worry about anyone noticing them.</li>
            <li><strong>Easy to Clean:</strong> Since the aligners are removable, you can brush and floss your teeth more easily than with other methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Convenient Removal and Replacement:</strong> You can remove the aligners when eating or cleaning your teeth, then easily put them back in place, allowing you to enjoy life fully.</li>
            <li><strong>Less Frequent Check-ups:</strong> Unlike metal braces, which require visits to the dentist every 3 – 4 weeks, clear aligners free up your schedule as you only need to visit the clinic every 6 – 8 weeks.</li>
            <li><strong>Know Your Treatment Duration in Advance:</strong> Clear aligners allow you to visualize each treatment stage and give you an overview of the entire treatment duration.</li>
