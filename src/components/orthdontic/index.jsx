            <h1>Understanding Braces</h1>
            <div id="new-paragraph">
              Braces are specialized devices, either fixed or removable, designed to move and align teeth into their correct positions. This not only enhances the appearance of your smile but also ensures proper chewing function and bite alignment, significantly improving dental health and overall facial aesthetics.

            <h1 style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>When Should You Consider Braces?</h1>
            <div id="new-paragraph">
              Braces are recommended for a variety of dental issues. Here are some specific conditions that braces can effectively address:
            </div>
            <ul id="ul">
              <li><strong>Protruding Teeth:</strong> These can cause aesthetic concerns and wear down more quickly due to improper bite alignment.</li>
              <li><strong>Underbite:</strong> This condition can affect facial aesthetics, chewing function, and may cause speech difficulties.</li>
              <li><strong>Spaced Teeth:</strong> Gaps between teeth can lead to food getting stuck, causing discomfort and impacting pronunciation.</li>
              <li><strong>Crowded Teeth:</strong> Overlapping teeth can cause aesthetic issues and make dental care challenging.</li>
              <li><strong>Open Bite:</strong> When the teeth do not meet properly, it can make chewing difficult and affect speech.</li>
              <li><strong>Deep Bite:</strong> This condition can cause facial imbalance and affect the temporomandibular joint.</li>
            </ul>
