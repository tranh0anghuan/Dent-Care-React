                    <div id="new-paragraph">Tooth extraction is a dental procedure to remove one or more teeth from the mouth. This procedure can be performed for various reasons.</div>
                    <div id="new-paragraph">Reasons for tooth extraction:</div>
                    <ul id="ul">
                        <li><strong>Severe tooth decay:</strong> When tooth decay has spread to the pulp and cannot be treated with fillings or root canal therapy, extraction is the only solution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Periodontitis:</strong> Periodontitis is a condition that affects the gums and bones around the teeth. If left untreated, it can lead to tooth loss.</li>
                        <li><strong>Misaligned teeth:</strong> Misaligned teeth can cause various problems, including pain, difficulty in oral hygiene, and aesthetic issues. In some cases, extracting misaligned teeth is necessary to create enough space for other teeth to align properly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Impacted wisdom teeth:</strong> Wisdom teeth are the last to emerge in adults. They often become impacted, causing pain, swelling, and infection. In this case, extracting wisdom teeth is necessary to eliminate the cause of these problems.</li>
