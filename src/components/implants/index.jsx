                    <p>Implant dentistry is the most effective solution for restoring lost teeth as it not only helps restore the aesthetics of the teeth and ensures normal chewing function, but implants also have the ability to maintain durability with many superior advantages.</p>    
                    <h1>What is Implant Dentistry?</h1>
                    <p>Implant dentistry (or implant placement) is a method that uses a titanium artificial tooth root placed into the jawbone at the site of the missing tooth. This tooth root will replace the real tooth root, and then a dental crown is attached to the implant root to create a complete tooth.</p>
                    <p>To date, implant placement remains the most modern and effective method for restoring lost teeth. It not only restores a confident appearance but also helps patients regain chewing function and effectively prevents dental issues and bone resorption.</p>

                    <h1>Should You Get Implants?</h1>
                    <p>It can be seen that implants are a modern method that effectively restores lost teeth, providing many benefits such as:</p>
                    <ul id="ul">
                        <li><strong>High Aesthetics:</strong> Compared to other methods of false teeth, implants offer high aesthetics with a size, shape, and color closely resembling real teeth.</li>
                        <li><strong>High Chewing Ability:</strong> By using an implant root to replace the lost tooth root, this method provides chewing ability similar to real teeth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prevents Bone Resorption:</strong> Unlike conventional false teeth methods, implants help restore the lost tooth root with a titanium post. This helps prevent bone resorption and other dental issues such as gum recession, tooth drift, and bad breath.</li>
                        <li><strong>Long Lifespan:</strong> In fact, the average lifespan of an implant post ranges from 20 to 30 years. With proper use, it can last a lifetime.</li>
