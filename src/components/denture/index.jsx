              <div>
              Dentures are artificial teeth designed to replace missing or severely damaged natural teeth. They restore chewing function, 
              improve the aesthetics of your smile and facial structure, boost self-confidence, and maintain the alignment of remaining natural teeth, enhancing overall quality of life.
