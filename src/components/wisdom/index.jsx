            <p>An impacted wisdom tooth is a misaligned tooth that needs to be removed early to prevent it from affecting adjacent teeth. However, the signs of an impacted wisdom tooth are not always clear and easy to recognize. In some cases, the tooth grows without causing pain, making it difficult for the patient to detect. Refer to the following article to recognize the appearance of impacted wisdom teeth early and how to handle them.</p>
            <h1>What Are the Signs of an Impacted Wisdom Tooth?</h1>
            <p>An impacted wisdom tooth is a tooth that is located beneath the gum and jawbone and cannot emerge above the gum line. In reality, impacted wisdom teeth can still grow normally or exist in cyst form, causing a lot of pain and discomfort. Some common signs of an impacted wisdom tooth include:</p>

            <h1>Are Impacted Wisdom Teeth Dangerous?</h1>
            <p>Initially, impacted wisdom teeth may not cause pain, but over time they will cause significant discomfort. Particularly during eating and drinking, early removal helps protect adjacent teeth. Some dangerous complications caused by impacted wisdom teeth include:</p>
            <h3>Causes Damage and Increases the Risk of Losing the Second Molar</h3>
            <p>Impacted wisdom teeth will continue to develop like other teeth. As they grow, they tend to move and press against the second molar, causing damage to the roots and body of the second molar, leading to persistent pain over time.</p>
            <h3>Increases the Risk of Gum Inflammation</h3>
            <p>Moving impacted wisdom teeth continuously damage the gums until they emerge or are completely removed. During this process, the gums are constantly affected and damaged by the teeth. Common signs of gum inflammation include swollen, red, painful gums, and pus formation.</p>
            <h3>Causes Jawbone Cysts</h3>
            <p>Impacted wisdom teeth not only damage the gums but also affect the jawbone, teeth, and nerves if not removed promptly. Jawbone cysts need to be detected and treated promptly to prevent severe complications to the jawbone structure.</p>
